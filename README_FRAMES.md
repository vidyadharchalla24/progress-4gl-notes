### Frames
- Any UI which we are interacting is called an Frame.
- It is a rectangular area with in a window which is used to display the field level widgets.
- **Frame Selection**
    -   If the statement explicitly names a frame, the statement uses that frame to display data.
    -   If the statement does not explicitly name a frame, Progress displays the data in the **default frame** for the block in which the statement occurs.
- **Static and Dynamic Frame**
    -   This is not a type of frame.
    - Static frame will be allocated during compile time and dynamic frame will be allocated during run time.
